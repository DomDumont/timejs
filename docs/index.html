        <article><p>This Is My Engine in JavaScript</p>
<p>My ridicule attempt to do a minimalist engine</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity is too big</li>
<li>GameMaker is expensive</li>
<li>Godot feels 'strange'</li>
</ul>
<p>So let's make another small and useless engine :-)</p>
<h3>Crazy enough to try ?</h3><ul>
<li>npm install</li>
<li>npm run build</li>
<li>npm start</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a side project, that's why (among other things) it does not progress fast</p>
<p>Let's test a new methodology I just invented on this mini project.
Because it's so hard to avoid procrastination on a side project</p>
<p>Step 1: program like a pig, as fast as possible, as if you were a freelance on the run, that the goal was just to do the bare minimum to get the money back from the contract and go to a far-off country where no one could ask you to be accountable for the crap you just programmed.</p>
<p>Step 2: Put yourself in the shoes of the guy who has just realized the trickery and who must find a way to arrange
things to save his company</p>
