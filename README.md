This Is My Engine in JavaScript

My ridicule attempt to do a minimalist engine

- Unity is too big
- GameMaker is expensive
- Godot feels 'strange'

So let's make another small and useless engine :-)

## Crazy enough to try ?

- npm install
- npm run build
- npm start

This is a side project, that's why (among other things) it does not progress fast

Let's test a new methodology I just invented on this mini project.
Because it's so hard to avoid procrastination on a side project

Step 1: program like a pig, as fast as possible, as if you were a freelance on the run, that the goal was just to do the bare minimum to get the money back from the contract and go to a far-off country where no one could ask you to be accountable for the crap you just programmed.

Step 2: Put yourself in the shoes of the guy who has just realized the trickery and who must find a way to arrange
things to save his company
